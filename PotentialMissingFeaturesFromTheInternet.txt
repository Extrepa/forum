# Errl Forum Research Notes (Classic Forum Organization + Info Tracking)

These notes summarize **how classic forums (especially early 2000s)** organized content, tracked user activity, and displayed information. Use this as a reference for building a “real forum feel” with strong usability and clear data workflows.

---

## 1) Core Organization Model (Forum Hierarchy)

Most classic forums use a clean hierarchy:

**Category → Forum/Section → Thread → Posts (Replies)**

### Example
- **Category:** Community
- **Section:** General
- **Thread:** “Welcome to the Nomads”
- **Posts:** replies inside the thread

### Why this works
- Scales cleanly (hundreds of topics, years of content)
- Users always know where they are
- Makes navigation predictable and comfortable

---

## 2) Thread Lists = “Decision Engine” (How forums show info at a glance)

Classic forums optimize for: **“What should I click next?”**

### Thread row info (common fields)
- Thread title
- Thread starter (author)
- Replies count
- Views count
- Last post time (relative/absolute)
- Last post author
- Status icons (new/locked/sticky/hot/poll)

### Example thread row (classic dense layout)
🔥 “Errl Lore Dump Thread”  
Starter: Geoff | Replies: 42 | Views: 9001 | Last Post: 2 mins ago by Extrepa

### Why it matters
- Allows fast scanning
- Threads feel alive (not dead lists)
- Makes activity visible without opening the thread

---

## 3) Thread Priority Lanes (Announcements / Stickies / Normal)

Most forums don’t list threads in one pile — they group them.

### Common order
1. **Announcements** (admin-only, top priority)
2. **Stickies** (forum-level pinned threads)
3. **Normal threads** (sorted by recent activity)

### Why it matters
- Important info doesn’t sink
- Users instantly recognize what’s “permanent” vs “current discussion”

---

## 4) Default Sorting “Physics” = Last Activity Wins

Classic forums usually sort thread lists by:

✅ **Most recent reply (“last post”)**

Not by creation date.

### Why it matters
- Threads naturally rise when people reply (“bumping”)
- Conversation feels active over time
- It’s a feed without being an algorithm

---

## 5) Unread Tracking (The Secret Sauce)

Unread tracking reduces friction and creates momentum.

### Two common systems

#### A) Forum-level read state
Tracks the last time a user visited the forum/section.

#### B) Thread-level read state
Tracks how far the user read inside a thread, such as:
- last read timestamp
- last read reply ID/index

### How it’s shown in UI
- Bold thread titles for unread
- “New” icon markers
- **Jump to first unread reply** (highly important)

### Why it matters
- Users always know what’s new
- Eliminates re-scrolling and re-hunting
- Encourages daily “check-in” behavior naturally

---

## 6) Pagination (Classic Forum Structure)

Classic forums often use pages instead of infinite scroll.

### Typical settings
- 10 / 20 / 50 replies per page
- Thread pages: 1 2 3 … 10

### Why it mattered historically
- Faster loading on older internet
- Easy linking (“Page 7 was chaos”)
- Predictable layout

### Modern hybrid option
- Pagination + “Load more replies”
- “Jump to bottom / newest reply” button

---

## 7) Navigation Helpers (Breadcrumbs + Forum Jump)

Classic forums made moving around extremely fast.

### Breadcrumbs
Example:
Home → General → Thread Title

### Forum Jump Dropdown
A dropdown to teleport to any section instantly.

### Why it matters
- Minimizes “back back back”
- Makes the forum feel like a connected world

---

## 8) Thread States / Icons = Visual Language

Forums encode meaning with small markers.

### Common thread states
- 🔒 Locked (no replies allowed)
- 📌 Sticky
- ✅ Solved/Answered (common in support forums)
- 🔥 Hot thread (high activity)
- 🗳 Poll thread
- 🆕 New posts since last visit

### Why it matters
- Fast scanning
- Reduces wrong-clicks
- Users know what’s happening instantly

---

## 9) Search + Filters (Not flashy, but mandatory)

Classic forum search options often include:
- Search by keyword
- Search by author
- Search within a specific forum only
- Search inside a thread
- Show results as:
  - Threads (summary)
  - Posts/replies (exact matches)

### Why it matters
Lore/story-heavy forums benefit hugely from:
- finding old posts
- finding references
- re-discovering classic threads

---

## 10) Subforums (Sections within sections)

Subforums help scale without cluttering the homepage.

### Example
Nomads
- Events  
  - Mayday Heyday  
  - The Happening  
  - Local Meetups  

### Why it matters
- Organizes deeper topics
- Keeps homepage clean
- Still preserves hierarchy clarity

---

## 11) Post Display Format (User Identity + Content Split)

Many classic forums use a consistent reply layout:

### Left column: user identity
- Avatar
- Username
- Rank/title
- Post count
- Join date
- Location
- Badges

### Right column: content
- Reply text
- Quotes
- Attachments
- Signature (optional)

### Why it matters
- Thread becomes readable at scale
- Community becomes “character-based” and recognizable

---

## 12) Quoting Culture (Conversation Remix)

Forums didn’t just “reply” — they quoted.

### Quote features
- Single quote
- Multi-quote
- Nested quotes (quote inside a quote)

### Why it matters
- Keeps long threads understandable
- Supports precise replies without confusion
- Classic forum debates + story-building rely on quoting

---

## 13) Moderation Tracking (Behind-the-scenes organization)

Good forums store and support:
- Soft delete vs hard delete
- Edit history (optional, but useful)
- Moderation logs (move/lock/delete actions)
- Report queue system

### Common moderation flow
Report → Mod reviews → Resolve → Logged action

### Why it matters
- Scales governance
- Prevents chaos
- Makes admin controls safer and reversible

---

## 14) “Last Post” Preview Info (Micro-context)

Thread lists often display:
- last reply author
- last reply timestamp
- sometimes a tiny snippet preview

### Why it matters
- Makes the list feel alive
- Improves scanning accuracy
- Reduces random clicking
