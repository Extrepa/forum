### Updated sign-in page intro text and styling

- Created a new branch `feature/update-signin-intro`.
- Modified `src/components/ClaimUsernameForm.js` to replace the old intro text with the new one provided by the user.
- Applied styling to the intro text: increased font size for the welcome message, and made the closing line larger, bolder, and a different accent color.
- Renamed branch to `feat/update-signin-intro`.
- Updated intro text in `src/components/ClaimUsernameForm.js` to "This forum is built for people who grew up".
- Reduced the bottom padding of the last line of the intro text.
- Adjusted the flex properties of the intro text and sign-in form sections to achieve a 50/50 split and allow for stacking on smaller viewports.
