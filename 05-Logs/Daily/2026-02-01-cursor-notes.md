- **Profile player + embeds:** Unified ProfileSongPlayer rendering for YouTube/SoundCloud/Spotify (embed iframe support, compact/full styles, consistent sizing), added compact progress bar, and stabilized autoplay vs pause behavior (SoundCloud getPaused + YouTube state sync).
- **Public profile layout:** Ensured header order stays username → role → mood → song, kept player pinned top-right on desktop without overflow, and preserved stacked column layout on mobile.
- **Edit profile mini-preview:** Kept a compact bar preview only (no overflow), tightened play/pause visibility, and ensured long song/provider labels truncate cleanly.
- **Username hover/popup:** Tightened hover hitbox to avoid “ghost” hover far from the username; popover positioning remains fixed to anchor.
- **Notifications panel:** Stabilized popover width and alignment so it doesn’t shrink unexpectedly on mobile/desktop.
- **Follow-up UI fixes:** Removed double borders on profile player embeds, tightened notifications popover to content, and fixed username popover width to stay fixed-size.
- **Tabs + defaults:** Default profile tab behavior supports “no default selected” and pill indicator hides when none is set; tabs reordered alphabetically and padding tightened.
- **Stats + activity parity:** Account edit and public profile stats/labels now match (including total contribution); recent activity list and “5 then scroll” behavior verified.
- **Profile extras & persistence:** Mood/song/headline save + read-back via profile-extras GET/POST; rollout-safe fallbacks for missing columns (migration 0054).
- **Gallery & notes:** Gallery limited to 10 uploads with modal preview; “Guestbook” display renamed to “Notes” and delete button compacted.
- **UI polish:** Avatar glow overflow fixes, socials icons on profile tabs, and compact layout adjustments across breakpoints.
- **Profile mood/song layout:** Moved the song column into the header slot and updated flex behavior for desktop wrap.
- **Edit profile preview:** Replaced embed with inline song text and added Headline label.
- **Gallery controls:** Added hover delete on thumbnails, delete action in modal, and removed migration note.
- **Gallery modal + cover:** Added cover button in modal, red glow X icons, and cover image background on profile header.
- **Cover modes:** Added cover mode buttons (fill/fit/stretch), new API + migration, and applied mode on profile header.
- **Review notes:** Cover mode persists via `profile_cover_mode` (migration `0058` required); modal uses `70vh` image cap so buttons stay visible; cover set updates gallery list but modal marks the selected entry as cover only (other entries update on list refresh).
- **Profile mood/song tweak:** Updated right-column flex/wrap defaults to match previewed layout adjustments.
- **Profile mood/song alignment:** Centered the song column within the desktop header for a more balanced layout.
- **Gallery modal actions:** Made action strip sticky/always visible, added cover preview background in edit profile header, fixed song autoplay, and restored right-column slot target.
- **Extras save fix:** Prevented cover mode refresh from wiping mood/song/headline and included headline in extras checks.
- **Edit profile tabs:** Added Username/Avatar sub-tabs and removed header buttons to reduce clutter.
- **Edit profile layout:** Kept username controls on one row, labeled color picker, trimmed extra spacing, and allowed username wrapping.
- **UI popovers:** Restyled notifications panel buttons and resized user hover card to match reference layout.
- **Popover polish:** Increased notification popover width and boosted user hover sizing/typography to match screenshots.
- **Popover sizing fix:** Shrunk user hover card padding/size and stabilized notifications width rules.
- **Notifications height:** Switched to taller popover and constrained list height for scroll.
