-Add better calendar features and RSVP / can you make a checkbox that adds you to a list of attendees in a subsection of the post
-Duplicate titling for posts, appears twice
-Welcome test needs changed
-If browser based login detected then it should show one thing and if they it doesn't show any browser based or cookies then it should just show a different thing for signing up 
- And then on the sign in box it should have the you know login box email and password if you're not logged in and then the create account button will be below that currently there's a create and a sign in button and it should be kind of a flow to where you know if you don't have an email and password then you'd click account create account below sign in and then it would get rid of the you know a sign-in and pop up the create account and vice versa 
- Navigation menu is showing up kind of funky. It should be a horizontal button that has the scrollable dropdown. The dropdown should be pretty short. It should only show about three or four options at a time, and we'll pick the top seen ones at the top 
- A random about page was added. We don't need an about page 
I want to combine a few pages I think. And I think I want to do, I want to put the art and the nostalgia page together. And then I also want to put the bugs and rants page together. I think they fit better as single pages 
- I notice now that on all the pages, things kind of got switched around to where the section title and description got moved below the posts. And that's not what I wanted. What I actually wanted was a combined card that has the title and the description. then right below that is the latest post and below that is all the other posts in the section and you know I want to kind of imagine you know what's gonna look like when there's tons of them in here someday and how these are all gonna look and how it'll scroll and just how it'll look organized and so let's make a plan for how we can fix all that 
- The bottom footers, the way they're wrapping, I don't like how it looks 
- The tagline at the bottom, instead of keep it weird, keep it real, keep it Errl, I want to say keep it weird, keep it drippy, keep it Errl 
- Instead of an Announcements page I think maybe what I can do is that on the feed page I could have a section for Announcements. You know I kind of want the feed to be the home page for people when they come back to the forum so if they signed up for an account instead of defaulting to Home it would default to Feed or maybe you can have a setting in the settings where you can pick what you want out of the two to load into 
- We also need to upgrade the way that the home looks after you've signed up and since we have more than six pages we should have more than six little page cards or page links you know showing posts since the the home and the feet are you know kind of showing similar purposes now 
- I was also thinking for testing notifications we should do kind of a welcome to the functionality kind of setup to where since clicking on Errl opens up you know a way to open up your account and check your notifications and potentially other things later I think we should have a little initial pop-up like a first notification that's like you know click here you know to navigate to your account and like you know welcome to the forum and just like um a basic little paragraph about like what clicking him will do and where it can take you
