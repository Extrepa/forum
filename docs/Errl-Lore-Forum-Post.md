**Suggested title:** Errl: The Drip That Followed Us Home

There are mascots you invent in a boardroom, and then there are mascots that *happen to you*. Errl is the second kind.

## The origin (Mayday Heyday, May 1, 2015)

Back in 2015, we were in the woods between Bend and Prineville building **Mayday Heyday**—a renegade event with a geodesic dome, a crew of friends, and a lot of sweat. Most of us are from Bend, but Geoff is from Prineville, and James’s house is in Prineville. Joel and Katie live in Prineville too. We’re all from Central Oregon. Right when the night was about to lift off, the sheriffs rolled in. **Pat**, who was throwing the gathering, got arrested. We all miss Pat, but we had to go anyway. Too much work and love had gone into it.

That’s when Geoff pulled out an old overhead projector from a school closet—glass plate, humming fan. He poured oil and water into a Petri dish, added dye, and set it on the light. Colors twisted and rolled across the clearing, bouncing off trees and faces. And in that swirl, a **small white shape** started to form. Round. Wide eyes. A little open mouth. That was Errl’s first moment in the world—*pulled together by chance and light*, witnessed by only a few.

Errl stands for **Effervescent Remnant of Radical Liminality**: a bubble-born leftover piece of light that decided to become a friend. **Consistency inside chaos.** The world melts; the vibe holds.

## What Errl looks like (the sacred bits)

Errl’s design is intentionally simple—so it stays consistent across pins, 3D, sprites, UI, you name it. The non-negotiables: a **rounded drippy goo silhouette**, a **strong face patch** on the front, **two simple oval eyes**, and a **tiny sideways oval mouth**. If those are intact, it’s Errl—even when the colors go full cosmic rainbow.

## Why Errl exists

Errl is a reminder that **art is a portal**, **memory is a place**, and **friendship stabilizes reality**. Sometimes the best characters aren’t “created”—they’re *noticed*. Errl grew out of the same orbit as **the Nomads**: the friends, the shows, the festival stories, the inside jokes that turn into canon. Geoff turned Errl into vinyl stickers (York Signs); they went on cars, laptops, gear. Errl became a **badge**: *I was there. We all made it happen.*

## The Errl ecosystem

Errl isn’t only a drawing. There’s almost no material that Errl hasn’t been made out of yet—crocheted and knit dolls, melted pearler art, carved pumpkins, drawings and coloring pages, string art, glowing totems, 3D prints, pins, stickers, and more. The community keeps finding new ways to bring Errl into the world.

The **Errl Portal** exists—I launched the website a while ago, and I’m very excited about that. You’re reading this on the **Errl Forum**, which you access from the Errl Portal. That’s what all this is. In the future, there are more projects in the works—**ErrlStory**, **Errl Club Simulator**, and other digital worlds—but Errl lives in both the digital and the physical things we make.

Ten years on, we still circle back. **The Happening** was the last thing that happened, and it wasn’t the greatest memory as far as connection with the people who threw it. But bigger and better things are coming. We hope to throw an **Errl Summer Camp** next year. Beats fade. Lights go out. **Errl’s wide-eyed amazed face stays.**

## What happens next

This forum is where we keep the lore alive—and where we expand it without losing the core. If you’ve got your first Errl sighting story, a favorite pin moment, an idea for a Portal region, or fan art, sprites, stickers—**post it**. Errl loves being witnessed.

Stay drippy.
