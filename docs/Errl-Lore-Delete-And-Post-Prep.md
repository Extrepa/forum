# Errl Lore: What to Delete & Post Prep

## What You Can Get Rid Of

All unique content from the source folders has been merged into the docs in this repo. After you’ve verified you’re happy with the lore docs, you can safely delete:

| Folder | Contents | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `~/Downloads/Errl/` | Original 8 files (origin, design, universe, etc.) | **Safe to delete** — merged into `Errl-Lore.md` |
| `~/Downloads/Errl 2/` | 12 files + `Errl_All_In_One.md` | **Safe to delete** — merged into `Errl-Lore.md` |
| `~/Downloads/Errl 3/` | Paper-canon extract, origin, forum example | **Safe to delete** — merged into `Errl-Lore.md`, narrative, and forum post |

**Before deleting:** Spot-check that you don’t need the original “Between the Glow and the Gathering” CNF essay file. If it lives *only* inside Errl 3 (e.g. as `00_source_extract_...` or similar), consider keeping a copy of the full essay elsewhere if you want it for reference. The extract is already reflected in the lore.

**Keep:** Any images, SVGs, or other assets that weren’t part of the markdown. The folders above are text/canon only.

## Lore & Memories Post Prep

### Docs in This Repo

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Errl-Lore.md](Errl-Lore.md) | Single source of truth: origin, character, design, world, projects, collaborators, guardrails |
| [Errl-Lore-Narrative.md](Errl-Lore-Narrative.md) | Literary, story-style version — “Between the Glow and the Gathering” |
| [Errl-Lore-Forum-Post.md](Errl-Lore-Forum-Post.md) | **Ready to copy-paste** into Lore & Memories |

### Which Version to Post?

- **Use [Errl-Lore-Forum-Post.md](Errl-Lore-Forum-Post.md)** for your first Lore & Memories post. It’s written as a forum post: hook, origin, design basics, ecosystem, CTA, sign-off. Length is ~500–700 words.
- **Optional:** You can paste a *short* excerpt from [Errl-Lore-Narrative.md](Errl-Lore-Narrative.md) as a follow-up or a separate “story” post if you want a more literary tone.

### Title Options

1. **Errl: The Goo That Followed Us Home** — Friendly, memorable, slightly whimsical.
2. **Between the Glow and the Gathering** — Tied to the essay; more evocative.
3. **Who (or What) Is Errl?** — Direct, good for a “first lore” explainer.

### How to Post

1. Go to **Lore & Memories** (or **Lore** if your forum uses that).
2. Create a new post.
3. Copy the **body** of [Errl-Lore-Forum-Post.md](Errl-Lore-Forum-Post.md) (everything under the `---` after the title/author). Paste into the post editor.
4. Set the **title** to one of the options above (or your own).
5. Post as **Extrepa** (or your preferred username).

### Optional Add-Ons

- **Image:** If you have a canonical Errl image (e.g. sticker, pin, simple mascot), attach it to the post.
- **Links:** Add links to the Errl Portal, Pin Designer, or other projects if you want the post to double as a hub.

*All set. Stay gooey.*
