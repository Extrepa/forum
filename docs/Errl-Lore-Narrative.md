# Between the Glow and the Gathering

*A narrative version of Errl’s origin—memory as story.*

---

The Nomads had built something in the pines outside Bend: a geodesic dome, ten-plus bodies, their fourth or fifth raise. Pat had hauled in five massive speakers and a generator the size of a trailer. The night was supposed to lift. Then the sheriffs came—red and blue through the dust—and the whole thing teetered. Restrictions. No more cars, no fires. Pat was gone. But they didn’t shut it down. Too much work. Too much love. The stages lit anyway.

Geoff dragged out an old overhead projector from a school closet. Glass plate. Humming fan. He poured oil and water into a Petri dish, added dye, and set it on the light. Color twisted and rolled across the clearing. It hit the trees. It hit our faces. And in that swirl, a small white shape began to form. Round. Wide eyes. A little open mouth.

That was Errl’s first moment in the world. Not a concept. Not a design. A *moment*—pulled together by chance and light, seen by only a few.

Errl never really left. Geoff turned that shape into a vinyl sticker through York Signs. We put it on cars, laptops, gear cases. Errl stopped being “a character” and became a badge: *I was there. I helped make it happen.*

Over the next two years we kept meeting. James’s house. Geoff’s warehouse. We stayed up until sunrise, mapping visuals onto walls, splitting projections, chasing the same spark. Errl became a glowing totem we carried into another event. Errl became dolls, pins, sprites, portals. Errl became a design language for tools and a mascot for connection. You don’t meet Errl. You get adopted into Errl’s gravity.

Ten years on, the Nomads still circle back every summer. The event changes names—this year it’s The Happening—but the soul stays the same. Crowdfunded. Built for love. Built because it’s home. We made an Errl Hunt, hid art around the site, printed pamphlets about the origin. We called the camp Errl Camp. Geoff rented a U-Haul and brought a Fireball pinball machine. The Clubhouse is still Geoff’s art space. Creativity happens at any hour.

Beats fade. Lights go out. Life changes shape. But Errl’s wide-eyed, amazed face stays.

*Consistency inside chaos. The world melts; the vibe holds. Stay gooey.*
