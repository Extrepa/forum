# Errl Forum Tone Guide (micro)

## Core vibe
- Friendly + slightly weird
- Casual cosmic / portal energy
- Light devlog / community bulletin
- Short lines, clean phrasing
- Funny, but not try-hard

## Rules
- Prefer “drip / transmission / portal / goo” metaphors in small doses
- Keep UI labels clear first, themed second
- Avoid walls of text
- Use ellipses sparingly for mystery (“Silence… suspicious.”)

## Good words
drip, goo, portal, transmission, vibe, sludge, lab, build, signal, spill

## Avoid
overly edgy, too random, or jokes that hide meaning of buttons

## Lore Integration (optional)
When using lore-inspired text (Nomads, Portal Keepers, Realms, etc.):
- Use sparingly — lore should enhance, not confuse
- Empathy-first language fits naturally ("Welcome", "Connect", "Harmonize")
- Realm names work well in empty states ("No Festival Layer connections detected")
- Keep it accessible — not everyone knows the deep lore
- When in doubt, default to the simpler "drip/goo/portal" language
