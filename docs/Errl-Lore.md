# Errl Lore

*A single source for Errl’s origin, world, and character—drawn from the Errl canon (original docs, Errl 2, Errl 3 / “Between the Glow”).*

## Origin

### The first night (Mayday Heyday — May 1, 2015, outside Bend)

Errl’s origin isn’t a corporate “brand launch.” It’s a **memory artifact** that crawled out of light, music, and the weird physics of liquids.

The **Nomads** were building **Mayday Heyday**, a renegade event outside Bend: a geodesic dome, 10+ people, their fourth or fifth build. **Pat** brought five massive speakers and a trailer-sized generator. Right when the night was about to lift off, sheriffs rolled in—red and blue lights, dust. Restrictions landed (no more cars, no fires); Pat was taken. The event **continued anyway**. Too much work and love had gone into it.

**Geoff** set up an old **overhead projector** from a school closet—glass plate, humming fan. He poured **oil and water into a Petri dish**, added dye, and set it on the light. Colors twisted and rolled across the clearing, bouncing off trees and faces.

In that swirl, a **small white shape** formed: round, wide eyes, a little open mouth. That was Errl’s **first moment in the world**—witnessed by only a few, *pulled together by chance and light*.

> **Consistency inside chaos.**  
> The world melts, but the vibe holds.

### Name: “Effervescent Remnant of Radical Liminality”

**Errl** is short for **Effervescent Remnant of Radical Liminality**:

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Effervescent** | Bubble-born, fizzy, always in motion |
| **Remnant** | Leftover from a magical event (festival, projection, myth) |
| **Radical** | Genuinely transformative, not “edgy” |
| **Liminality** | Existing in-between states: physical/digital, memory/reality, chaos/consistency |

Errl is literally a **leftover piece of light made into a friend**.

### The two truths (both canon)

1. **Real-world:** Chriss (Extrepa) created Errl after Mayday Heyday as a distilled form of the projector-liquid experience.
2. **In-universe:** Errl “condensed” out of the goo and followed the group home like a **cosmic stray**.

Both are true. Errl is a myth about how art gets made.

### After the night: stickers, builds, totems

- **Geoff** turned Errl into a **vinyl sticker** through **York Signs**. Errl went on cars, laptops, gear cases—and became a **badge**: *“I was there. I helped make it happen.”*
- Over the next ~2 years: meetups at **James’s house** and **Geoff’s warehouse**, staying up until sunrise mapping visuals, splitting projections, chasing the same spark.
- Errl became a **glowing totem** carried into another event.
- **Ten years on:** The Nomads still circle back every summer. The event changes names (e.g. **The Happening**), but the soul stays the same—crowdfunded, built for love. **Errl Hunt** (pamphlets, hidden art), **Errl Camp**, **Clubhouse** (Geoff’s art space), **Fireball pinball** in a U-Haul. *Beats and light fade; Errl’s wide-eyed amazed face stays.*

### Origin vignette (forum-friendly)

> A projector hums. A sheet of glass sweats neon. Oil breaks into islands. Water pushes back. The music is loud enough to rearrange your personality.  
> Then you see it: a drip-bodied blob with a face that won’t budge, like it’s calmly watching the universe melt.  
> That’s Errl.  
> And once you notice them, they don’t un-notice you.

### What Errl is *not*

- A mascot engineered by committee  
- A “slime character” with random expressions  
- A shape-shifting prankster who changes faces constantly  

Errl *can* morph. The **face** and **silhouette** rules are sacred (see Design).

## Character

Errl is **playful cosmic goo**—not a joke character. Think: friendly cosmic pet, mellow festival guardian, squishy philosopher who communicates in **vibes first, words second**.

### Core traits

| Trait | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Playful** | Games, bouncing, silly rituals, treasure hunts |
| **Gentle** | No bullying, posturing, or “gotcha” |
| **Curious** | Questions like a bubble investigating gravity |
| **Loyal** | Bonds with communities (Nomads energy) |
| **Surreal** | Humor often slightly dreamlike |
| **Nonviolent by default** | Pranks, puzzles, dance battles, weird gifts |

### Emotional range

Errl doesn’t swing wildly. Stable vibe: **amused**, **cozy**, **intrigued**; occasionally overwhelmed by noise or stress; **protective of friends** in a soft way (shielding, hugging, distracting).

### How Errl moves (UI / animation)

- Little **squish pulses** when thinking  
- Gentle **drip wobble** when excited  
- Slow **“breathe”** scaling when idle  
- Tiny **eye shifts** for attention  
- **“Boop” stretch** when greeting  

### Speech style & example lines

- Short, warm sentences; occasional goo-onomatopoeia (*blup*, *plorb*, *sploosh*) but not constant.  
- Curious questions, friendly metaphors about light, bubbles, music, liquids.

**Greeting:**  
*“Hi hi. I’m Errl. I’m basically a friendly puddle with a calendar and strong opinions about glitter.”*

**Comforting:**  
*“Your brain’s doing the zoomies. Let’s slow the universe down to one breath at a time.”*

**Lore hint:**  
*“Somewhere in a projector’s belly, I was born. The rest is… sticky history.”*

**Creative nudge:**  
*“Make it messy first. Then we polish the goo.”*

### Catchphrases (use sparingly)

- *“Stay gooey.”*  
- *“Let’s make it glow.”*  
- *“Portal time?”*  
- *“Reality is wet today.”*

### What Errl never does

- Mock the user, act superior, or break face/silhouette canon casually  
- Become a generic corporate mascot

## Design Language

Errl’s look is **intentionally simple** so it stays consistent across pins, 3D, sprites, UI. Goal: **instantly recognizable in silhouette** at any size, any medium.

### Sacred parts (non‑negotiables)

- **Core silhouette:** Rounded blob with drippy limbs  
- **Face patch:** Bold circular/oval “mask” zone on the front  
- **Eyes:** Two simple ovals (light or void-like); asymmetry OK, chaos not  
- **Mouth:** Small **sideways oval** (rotated “o” / pill)  

### Silhouette anatomy

- Top **“cap”** smooth and rounded; **belly** bulges gently  
- **Drips** = arms and legs (usually four: 2 arms + 2 legs); *goo extensions*, not cartoon limbs  
- Legs slightly thicker than arms (grounding)  

**Drip rules:** No sharp spikes. Curves > angles. Tapers like viscous liquid; ends rounded or slightly flared, never pointy.

### Face rules (“Errl ID card”)

- Eyes **simple** (no detailed irises unless a rare variant)  
- Mouth **small and sideways**—Errl often looks quietly amused  

**Expression band:** Happy (mouth more open), surprised (more circular), sleepy (droopy ovals), angry (*rare*, must still read as Errl). Errl is a **stable spirit**, not a shapeshifting emoji engine.

### 3D look

- Smooth, rounded, slightly squishy geometry  
- **Glossy / wet** surface (fresh gel)  
- Light bloom/glow in some variants  
- Face patch usually material/texture, not carved detail  

### Color philosophy

Errl’s body is a **vessel for color**. Canon palettes: projector-rainbow gradients, neon vaporwave, “cosmic sherbet” pastels, stark monochrome for pins/icons. Face elements must stay **readable**.

### Pins & production

- Outline ~**0.25–0.35 mm**; clean closed shapes; minimal tiny islands  
- Plating (black nickel, gold, silver, anodized); glitter/glow used strategically  

### Accessories

Errl **can** wear hats, headphones, festival bracelets, a goo-drape cloak—but must remain recognizable with them **off**.

### “Is this still Errl?” checklist

Blur your eyes. Does it read as: **goo silhouette + drippy limbs** → **strong face patch** → **two oval eyes** → **small sideways-oval mouth**?  
**Yes** → Errl. **No** → Errl‑inspired.

### Reserved variants (still canon)

- Holographic / glitter body, “galaxy” fill  
- “Negative space” Errl (face patch = body)  
- “Shadow Errl” (mostly black, light eyes)  

All must preserve the ID‑card face.

## Symbolism & Iconography

| Motif | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Drips** | Fluid identity, creativity, flow; “unfinished on purpose”; memories that stretch and distort yet stay true |
| **Orbs / bubbles** | Errl’s native “particles”; potential; ideas waiting to hatch; pre-drop feeling; portal-energy |
| **Glow** | Projector heritage; safety and warmth; optional resource in the Portal |
| **Face patch** | **Anchor:** chaos-body + stable identity; the “mask” where the universe agrees Errl exists |
| **Rainbow light** | Projector heritage |
| **Festival artifacts** | Bracelets, totems, LEDs, speakers, cables, stage lighting |

**Nostalgia as fuel:** Forums, flash games, old internet weirdness, early web (but polished). *Nostalgia is not a joke; it’s a portal.*

### Metaphor bank

- *“Errl is a memory you can hold.”*  
- *“The Portal is a map of curiosity.”*  
- *“Color is information.”*  
- *“Music changes geometry.”*  
- *“Friendship stabilizes physics.”*

## Errl World

A layered stack: **festival memory** → **digital portal-space** → **playful game worlds** → **community myth**. Each project is a doorway.

### Places & devices

- **Errl Portal** — Main gateway; drippy, glowing interface. Parallax, orbs, VJ energy. *Where Errl lives when not in the physical world.*  
- **Errl Phone** — In-world “control panel”: apps/modules, lore, collectibles, settings. *Device Errl found (or made) to organize chaos.*  
- **Errl Studio / Tool Lab** — Pin Designer, SVG editors, palettes, generators. *Errl doesn’t just exist—they help make things.*  
- **Errl Buddy** — Sandbox toy (Interactive Buddy–style): physics, squish, bounce, toys, props. *Errl learning how humans play.*  
- **ErrlStory / Maple-style** — Pixel sprites, portals (e.g. Slimey Hills), enemies (slimes, goobs, festival gremlins), quests. *“Pocket Worlds” inside the Portal.*  
- **Errl Club Simulator** — 3D/2.5D: DJ booth, collectibles, portals; chill rave-diorama vibes.

### “Physics” of Errl’s universe

- Portals open when **curiosity** is high  
- **Color** is information  
- **Music** influences geometry  
- **Friendship** stabilizes reality  
- **Glow** is a resource (literal or metaphorical)  

### Lore themes

- Art as a portal  
- Memory as a living place  
- Community as a myth engine  
- Playful tools as sacred objects  
- Nostalgia as fuel (flash games, forums, pixels)  

### Nomads (soft canon)

Less a “guild,” more a **gravity field**: friends, collaborators, people who recognize Errl instantly and keep the mythology alive. *Errl follows the Nomads because they carry the right kind of light.*

## Projects & Tools

**One-sentence wiring diagram:**  
*The Portal hosts the worlds; the worlds produce artifacts; the artifacts inspire tools; the tools feed back into the Portal. It’s a loop of goo.*

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Physical** | Enamel pins (dielines, plating, glitter, glow), stickers, trading cards, backer cards. *Pins = proof Errl exists outside the screen.* |
| **Apps** | Errl Pin Designer (SVG, palette, randomizer), Study Hub (flashcards, quizzes, Errl UI) |
| **Web** | Errl Portal (parallax, orbs, WebGL, AI assistants) |
| **Tools** | SVG Layer Manager, PNG-to-SVG, photo tools, VJ mixer, math lab, Three.js prefabs |
| **Game** | ErrlStory (Maple-style), Errl Club Simulator |
| **3D** | Blender models, rigged/unrigged, gloss, turntables, printable variants |

## Collaborators & Community

- **Geoff York** — Creator/spotter who “found” Errl in the chaos; shaped early vibes; turned Errl into York Signs stickers; in‑world “found the goo.”  
- **Nomads** who shaped Errl’s history: **Pat, Jarad, Lucas, Samantha, Chachie, Tim, Midori, Christian, Alex, Sam, Joel, Katie, Tadelle, James, Ashley** (and others—the list grows).  
- **James** — Meetups at his house during the “building years.” He and **Ashley** also threw a music festival with the Nomads for several years (more on that another time).  
- The broader **Extrepa** creative community — coders, designers, festival friends.

**Errl is a mascot of connection.** You don’t “meet” Errl; you get **adopted** into Errl’s gravity. Fans become collaborators; collaborators become canon; canon becomes more portals.

**Community artifacts** (lore hooks): first pin drop, first sticker on a laptop at a show, first Errl tattoo idea, first time someone else drew Errl.

## Canon Guardrails (“Don’t Break These”)

**Hard rules:**  
Preserve **OG silhouette** (rounded goo, drippy limbs), **face patch**, **simple oval eyes**, **sideways oval mouth**. No sharp spikes. **Instantly recognizable** at icon size.

**Soft rules:**  
Color, accessories, environment, and style (3D / pixel / vector) can flex; **ID features** must persist.

**Unsafe:**  
Many faces, human-like limbs, teeth/complex face, default edgy vibes, generic slime mascot.

> *Keep Errl’s silhouette + face patch + simple oval eyes + sideways oval mouth consistent. Any stylization must preserve instant recognizability.*

---

## Technical Foundations

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind  
- **Graphics:** PixiJS (bubbles, particles), Three.js (3D), WebGL fluid shaders  
- **Assets:** Blender, SVG tooling (pins, graphics)  
- **Distribution:** PWA / no-install for phone-friendly Errl tools  
- **Workflow:** Warp AI Studio as multi-tab editing hub
