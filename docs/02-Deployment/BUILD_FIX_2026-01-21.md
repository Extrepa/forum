# Build Fix - Import Path Correction

## Issue
Build failed with module resolution errors:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../../../../lib/db'
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../../../../lib/auth'
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../../../../lib/admin'
```

## Root Cause
The file `src/app/api/forum/[id]/replies/[replyId]/delete/route.js` had incorrect import paths. It was using 6 levels up (`../../../../../../`) when it needed 7 levels up (`../../../../../../../`).

## Fix Applied
Updated import paths in `src/app/api/forum/[id]/replies/[replyId]/delete/route.js`:
- Changed from: `../../../../../../lib/db`
- Changed to: `../../../../../../../lib/db`
- Same for `lib/auth` and `lib/admin`

## Path Calculation
File location: `src/app/api/forum/[id]/replies/[replyId]/delete/route.js`
To reach `src/lib/`:
1. `delete/` → `[replyId]/` (1 level: `../`)
2. `[replyId]/` → `replies/` (2 levels: `../../`)
3. `replies/` → `[id]/` (3 levels: `../../../`)
4. `[id]/` → `forum/` (4 levels: `../../../../`)
5. `forum/` → `api/` (5 levels: `../../../../../`)
6. `api/` → `app/` (6 levels: `../../../../../../`)
7. `app/` → `src/` (7 levels: `../../../../../../../`)

## Verification
- ✅ All import paths corrected
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All API routes follow consistent import pattern

## Additional Fixes
- Improved URL handling in EditPostButton callback to use URLSearchParams for better compatibility
