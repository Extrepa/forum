# Edge Plan (Stub)

Purpose: lightweight note for future edge hardening without changing behavior.

Planned (no commitments):
- Use middleware to add invite/role gates when needed.
- Move outbound notifications to a Queue wrapper when traffic grows.
- Add Durable Object for presence/activity if real-time signals are desired.
- Add Browser Rendering route for OG/preview assets if needed.
